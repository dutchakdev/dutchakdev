# February 24, 2022 Russia attacked Ukraine

Today, Ukraine is bombarded by Russian missiles. Civilians are dying. Russia compares our cities to the ground, hiding behind the fact that our military bases are located there. Russia is stuck in a lie, Russia is the biggest lie.

Our military give a worthy rebuff to the Russian invaders, the whole country is united. We will never forget this.

So far, 128 children have been killed. Russians steal thousands of children from the occupied territories and blackmail their parents. Many cases of rape and execution of elderly people have been recorded.

We won't forgive.
We ask the world for help, help us close the sky. No need to participate in the war, we can handle it ourselves, give us weapons!
